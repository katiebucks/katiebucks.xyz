*“Buckle up, babes—privacy is punk, and honesty is art.”*

Welcome to the inaugural post. Here’s what you can expect:

1. **Raw VLOG entries** on creativity, trans life, and tech freedom.  
2. **Blog essays** unpacking philosophy, cybersecurity, and indie artistry.  
3. **Zero trackers**—because you deserve your thoughts un-harvested.

Stay tuned, stay fierce, and—above all—stay invisible to the eyes that don’t deserve to see.
