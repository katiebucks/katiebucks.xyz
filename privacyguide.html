        <h2>The Internet Is Not Your Friend</h2>
        <p class="section-text">Every click, search, and message you send is being logged—whether by your internet provider, Big Tech, advertisers, or government agencies. Privacy is no longer just a niche concern for tech-savvy users; it’s about safeguarding your identity, data, and freedom.</p>
        <p class="section-text">Still think this is paranoia? Watch <em>Snowden</em>—yes, the film from nearly 20 years ago. The surveillance programs exposed back then were alarming. Today, they’re far worse.</p>

        <h2>The Power of Inferred Data</h2>
        <p class="section-text">Companies and governments track not just what you say online, but what you don’t say. This is known as inferred data.</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>📌 You never told Facebook you were job hunting, but after searching for resume templates, LinkedIn ads flood your feed.</li>
            <li>📌 Your browsing habits suggest a political preference, so your social media starts nudging you in a certain direction.</li>
            <li>📌 Your purchase history and ad clicks flag you as a target for predatory loan offers.</li>
